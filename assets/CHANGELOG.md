# BigWigs Real Voice


A plugin for BigWigs that utilizes Google Cloud Platform's Text-To-Speech service to provide high-quality voice alerts for boss abilities and other in-game events.

This can be particularly useful for players who prefer auditory cues over visual ones, or for those who want to stay focused on the game without constantly checking their screen.

If you're looking for a way to enhance your World of Warcraft experience with voice-based alerts, BigWigs Voice GCP is definitely worth considering.
